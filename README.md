# How to run your own Streamlit hackathon 

This repository provides all the resources needed to organize your own Streamlit-focused hackathon or to include Streamlit in a hackathon you're already planning.

Let's dive in!

## 🧑‍🏫 1. Introduction to Streamlit presentation
At the beginning of your hackathon, you may want to present an introduction to Streamlit to teach your hackers the basics. We have an [intro to Streamlit slide deck](Intro_to_Streamlit.pptx) that you can use for this purpose, or you can share one of the [intro to Streamlit videos](https://github.com/carolinedlu/streamlit-hackathon/blob/main/videos.md) with your attendees.

## 📝 2. Challenge statements
A hackathon challenge statement is a concise description of the challenge that participants are expected to address and solve during the hackathon event. It outlines the specific problem or goal that participants need to tackle using their creativity, technical skills, and innovative thinking.

Dive into a variety of Streamlit-related challenge statements [here](https://github.com/carolinedlu/streamlit-hackathon/tree/main/challenge-statements).

## 🏗️ 3. Support for app builders
If your hackathon participants have questions about using Streamlit or need help resolving errors with their apps, feel free to direct them to the following resources.

Streamlit's forum is the best place to ask technical questions. The forum is monitored by Streamlit employees, Community Moderators, and our awesome community of developers. Check out our forum [here](https://discuss.streamlit.io/).

Streamlit's Discord server is a great place to chat with the Streamlit community. Join the server [here](https://discord.gg/bTz5EDYh9Z) and feel free to share your technical questions in #community-hackathons.

## 🏆 4. Prizes for winners
We're happy to send swag to the winners of your Streamlit-themed hackathon or the Streamlit category of your hackathon. Once the winners have been selected, instruct them to complete [this form](https://forms.streamlit.io/community-hackathons) and we'll send each of them a Streamlit T-shirt!
